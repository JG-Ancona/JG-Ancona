### Hello everyone! 

Welcome to my Github profile!

I'm a MEng. Industrial engineer making my way into the tech world. I'm a data driven person and enjoy coding. I started coding years ago with Arduino, that it is basically C and C++, but I really started my path with Python. You will find a couple of code snippets here.

Besides that, I was selected for a training program call _Skills for Hiring - Atlantic_. I am participating in both branches of the program: **Data Analytics** and **Web Development**

I have currently a repository with code snippets related to the program:

You can also check my stats of the languages I use:

Thank you and happy coding!
