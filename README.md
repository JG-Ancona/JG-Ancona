# Hello everyone! 

#### Welcome to my Github profile

## About Me   [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-%230077B5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jgancona/)

I'm a MEng. Industrial engineer making my way into the tech world. I'm a data driven person and enjoy coding. I started coding years ago with Arduino, that it is basically C and C++, but I really started my path with Python. You will find a couple of code snippets here.

Besides that, I was selected for a training program call [Skills for Hiring - Atlantic](https://skillsforhire.ca/). I am participating in both branches of the program: **Data Analytics** and **Web Development**

I have currently a repository with code snippets related to the program:
